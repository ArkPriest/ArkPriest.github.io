## Welcome

I am Student at the University of Edingurgh - Zhejiang University Institude. This is my public github respository.

You can see the [editor on Github](https://github.com/r0bah0lic/r0bah0lic.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, Github Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, form the content in your Markdown files.
